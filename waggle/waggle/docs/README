To devlop with this library do the following:

1. Setup a local directory - with the appropiate python suffix
    mkdir $HOME/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages
          ^         ^ ^                         ^
          |-local---| |                         |
             part     |-python suffix ----------|

    note: python suffix is fixed, local part is up to you to choose

2. Export Python path (maybe even put it in your .bashrc), same directory as before
    export PYTHONPATH=$HOME/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages
                      ^         ^ ^                         ^
                      |-local---| |                         |
                         part     |-python suffix ----------|
                      

3. Locally run ./setup_all, running it from a different directory has undefined behavior
    ./setup_all.py develop --prefix=$HOME/local
                                    ^         ^
                                    |-local---|
                                       part
